# Naive-Bayes-Classifier

Spam data is taken from University of California, Irvine.
Naive Bayes Classifier(Bernoulli, Multinomial, Guassian) is used for Spam detection using sklearn.

###### Observations:

1. For bernoulli classifier, if the binarizer is set to None, then the accuracy is very less which is 60%. But if the binarizer is set to 0.1, then the accuracy of the classifier increases to 98%.
2. Accuracy for Multinonial classifier is 84% while that of Guassian is 99.7%. This shows that Guassian Naive Bayes Classifier performs good as compared to the other two with maximum accuracy.
